# kickstarts-with-coding-agent

Coding agents are helping developers become more productive.
One area of special interest is how we can help our users build AI agents.
We want to help you get started locally and have your AI agent built and running on OpenShift quickly.
With the help from a coding agent, this is now easier than ever, the coding agent will follow our guidelines to help you!
